# cassandra-data-modelling

Apache Cassandra, being a NoSQL database, is suitable for storing big data for quick read and write operations, high availability, linear scalability (via data distribution) and query optimization. The project requires data to be stored in a denormalized form that is optimized for specific queries. With this in mind, three data models are created for three tables, one for each query.
